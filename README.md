Crowd-Sourced Review Site (My Restaurant Review)

Create an application where users may rate local restaurants.

* The restaurant will have many ratings.

* Ratings may be any metric of your choosing, and could include a comment/explanation.

* Use a helper to display nicely formatted timestamps, and/or represent ratings visually (ie: display stars, or thumbs up/thumbs down).

* Include at least one computed property.

* Use a service to allow users to create a list of “favorite restaurants”.

* There should be an option to add new restaurants/things to review. This can either be an admin-style page, or something available to all users.
